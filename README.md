## Test app

What it does:

- show a header that sticks to the top of the page when the page scrolls
- show a navigation menu on the left of the page. The menu itself can be expanded & collapsed per the designs
- populates the navigation by pulling in data from an API

It uses BEM CSS notation for styles and React testing library + jest for tests.

Requires Node 12 (doesn't work with 14 yet due to some nested dependency issues).
